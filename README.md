# Guardian of galaxETH

**Guardian of galaxETH** is a fully-onchain game, part of an experiment in self-sustaining protocols within autonomous worlds. Without creating new tokens, it aims to establish and experiment with self-sustaining models for blockchain gaming, incorporating quadratic funding (QF) governance of public goods, and supporting the growth of the Ethereum blockchain.

In the game, you must form alliances with other players and build communities. Within these communities, players use QF voting to choose tools and attack monsters. The use of public goods (tools) affects the entire universe, continually enhancing the security, scalability, decentralization, and user experience across the ecosystem. Players gain reputation by influencing the ecosystem with public goods and helping others, simulating the accumulation of reputation within a community and the importance of public goods.

On a universal scale, **Guardian of galaxETH** simulates the process of Ethereum constantly upgrading and iterating to become stronger and more resilient.
